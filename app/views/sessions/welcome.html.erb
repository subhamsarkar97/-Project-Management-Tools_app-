        Project management tool has the capacity to help plan, 
        organize, and manage resource tools and develop resource estimates. 
        Depending on the sophistication of the software, it can manage estimation 
        and planning, scheduling, cost control and budget management, resource allocation,
        collaboration software, communication, decision-making, quality management, 
        time management and documentation or administration systems. Today, numerous
        PC and browser-based project management software and contract management 
        software solutions exist, and are finding applications in almost every 
        type of business. In the period between 1965 and 1969 were formed two of 
        the leading project management associations: the International 
        Project Management Association (IPMA) in Europe, and the Project Management
        Institute (PMI) which trains project management professionals and issues
        certificates. With business shifting towards technology-based and paperless 
        methods, the first project management systems started to emerge. Oracle and 
        Artemis launched their project managers in 1977, while Scitor Corporation did 
        the same in 1979. Many improvements followed in the upcoming decades: 
        in 1986, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute introduced 
        capability maturity software, a five-level project management method for 
        rapidly maturing processes, while in 1988 users met earned value management 
        which added processes’ scope and cost to the schedule.
